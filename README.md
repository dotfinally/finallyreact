# .finally(React)

### Where simplicity meets functionality

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/finallyreact.svg?color=005711)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/finallyreact)

FinallyReact is a React design library created with flexibility and usability in mind.

- A full design and component library for your React application
- Easily remove default styles on any component so you can style it with your own brand
- Your classnames take precedence over component styling
- A comprehensive set of utility class shortcuts, for faster styling
- Accessibility focused and tested

**`FinallyReact is currently in beta (pre version 1) and not recommended for production use yet`**

## Documentation

You can find examples of all component, design, and utility elements on the [FinallyReact website](https://finallyreact.com).

## To use in your project

- `npm install finallyreact`
- Import FinallyReact CSS in your app, most likely in a top level app file: `import 'finallyreact/main.css'`
- Import components as needed, for example: `import { Column, Row, Card } from 'finallyreact'`
- (optional) create a config file in the root of your project (see below)
- (optional) use PurgeCSS to reduce the size of the CSS bundle (see below)

### Config (optional)

To set global settings, create a `finally.config.js` file in the root of your project.

Below are the available options, with default values:

```js
export default {
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 600,
    sm: 900,
    md: 1200,
    lg: 1600,
    xl: 2000,
    xxl: 2400
  },
  simple: false
}
```

### PurgeCSS (optional)
To reduce the size of the CSS bundle, you can use PostCSS and PurgeCSS. Below is example configuration to add to PostCSS:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  plugins['@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss'] = {
    content: ['./**/*.js', './**/*.jsx', './**/*.ts', './**/*.tsx', './**/*.html'],
    defaultExtractor: (content) => {
      const matches = content.match(/[\w-/:]+(?<!:)/g) || [];
      return matches.concat(matches.map((match) => match.replace(/\//g, '\\/')));
    }
  };
}
```

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

- The build size of my project is too large after including FinallyReact styles
  - Try using PurgeCSS to reduce the size of the CSS bundle (see steps above)

- Importing `finallyreact/main.css` in my NextJS _app.js file isn't applying styles correctly
  - Try importing it in a separate .scss file instead, with `@import '~finallyreact/main.css';`
